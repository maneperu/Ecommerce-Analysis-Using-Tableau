Our objective is to utilize Tableau's robust capabilities to craft a compelling narrative from the provided datasets. This task encompasses thorough data preparation, intelligent data modeling, and the skillful application of calculated fields and Tableau functions for sophisticated analysis. The ultimate aim is to construct an interactive and intuitive dashboard in Tableau that showcases key discoveries, offering concise, actionable insights into e-commerce optimization.
